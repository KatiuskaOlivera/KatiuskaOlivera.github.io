We are interested in how the rates at which economies of different countries grow are related to the initial wealth levels in each country controlling for country's institutional, educational, and other similar characteristics, too find the speed of convergence/divergence. This is a replicate of the paper [Janis Kueck](https://www.kaggle.com/janniskueck/double-lasso-for-the-convergence-hypothesis?scriptVersionId=68854111).
