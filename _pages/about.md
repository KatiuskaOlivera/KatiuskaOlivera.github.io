About Me
======
<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am an economics student in my last year at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP). I currently work as a trainee at Credivision Peru, a branch of World Vision Fund, an EDPYME with social purposes the main one being the financial inclusion of rural areas. I'm interested in economic history, specifically pre-colonial times. I recently learned how to code and I love it, I hope to learn more and develop enough skills to make it a living. I also have a kitten named Athena that I love and cannot live without.

Moreover, besides pretending that I know what I'm doing in life, I'm very good at tetris.
